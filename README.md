# Cosine-Similarity
# Introduction
Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure the similarity between two non-zero vectors in a vector space. It determines the cosine of the angle between the vectors, hence the name "cosine similarity."

To calculate the cosine similarity between two vectors, you can use the following formula:

cosine_similarity(A, B) = (A . B) / (||A|| * ||B||)

Where:
- A and B are the two vectors you want to compare.
- A . B represents the dot product of vectors A and B.
- ||A|| and ||B|| represent the magnitudes (or lengths) of vectors A and B, respectively.

The resulting cosine similarity value will range between -1 and 1. A value of 1 indicates that the vectors are identical, 0 indicates no similarity, and -1 indicates that the vectors are diametrically opposed.

Cosine similarity is often used in various applications such as information retrieval, text mining, document similarity analysis, and recommendation systems, where it helps to determine the similarity between documents or items based on their vector representations.
